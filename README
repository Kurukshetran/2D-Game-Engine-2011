GameEngine is the base engine. GravityEngine, PlatformerEngine, and RTSEngine
all use the classes found within Game Engine. Plumber of the Living Dead,
GravityGame, and ZombieRTS are all proof-of-concept games which show the
GameEngine's capabilities.

The Engine code is designed to be as flexible as possible and to allow simple,
quick creation of new games.
